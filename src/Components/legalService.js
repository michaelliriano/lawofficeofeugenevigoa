                The Florida "As Is" contract has thee options in selecting the
                title agent. In Miami-Dade and Broward County, the buyer usually
                selects the closing agent or title company. Most title companies
                will charge the seller a settlement fee to prepare the closing
                document which consists of the Warranty Deed and several other
                documents, but they do not represent you and cannot give you
                legal advise.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, the seller has the right to have an attorney represent
                them in the closing and to prepare seller's documents. Make sure
                that your legal rights are protected. Below is an outline of the
                benefits of hiring an attorney to represent you in the sale of
                your home. ​ •Review the sales contract. If seller has already
                signed a contract with a buyer and attorney will review the
                contract and make sure that the buyer abides by the terms of the
                contract.

                  If you are buying a home, you will need to select a settlement
                  agent to do the closing. If you are a first-time home buyer,
                  you probably are unware of the role of the closing agent or
                  title company. Usually, the buyer relies on a recommendation
                  by their realtor or someone else in selecting a settlement
                  agent.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, if you are purchasing a bank owned property (an REO
                  or foreclosure), or from an investor, the seller may require
                  that the buyer close with their settlement agent. If that is
                  the case, you still have the legal right to have an attorney
                  represent to make sure you are protected.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An attorney will assist in reviewing the contract (and all
                  addenda and rider), especially before you sign it. If you
                  already signed the contract, an attorney can review the
                  contact and explain your rights. Most importantly, an attorney
                  will review the title commitment, lien search and estoppel to
                  ensure that you purchase the property with clear title and
                  without liens.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Keep in mind this: once you purchase the home, any problems
                  not resolved prior to closing become your problems. ​ Mostly
                  importantly, an attorney will also answer your questions and
                  give you legal advice.
